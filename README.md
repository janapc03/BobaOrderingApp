# **Bubble Tea Blast**
## *About*

This application is a bubble tea ordering simulation that
allows you to select a drink with a flavor, size, and
toppings and add it to your order. Bubble Tea Blast is
primarily meant to be a game for people who enjoy casual
games. Personally, I am a fan of low-intensity, chill games,
and I love bubble tea, so I decided on this project topic
based on my personal interests.
